🌿💥 Turbo-Garden is the little baby brother of The Garden, still free and lovingly crafted for live coding environments like Strudel, TidalCycles, and any other platform supporting .wav or .mp3 formats.

This one doesn’t punch, it slaps you in the face (or ears?) with extreme violence.

Turbo-Garden will keep growing: regular updates will keep it fresh, wild, and inspiring.

☕❤️❤️ It’s never too late to share a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/mot4i) (or anything else) if this pack made your code a little brighter.
